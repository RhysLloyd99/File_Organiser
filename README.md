# File_Organiser
This is a python project designed to help users manage their files effectively. It allows them to perform tasks such as filtering files by type, size or date, file searching and archiving or deleting files by date. This project demonstrates a practical understanding of pythons os and shutil modules.

Features:

File sorting: Files can be sorted into folders based on their type / extension (e.g. image files).
File renaming by date: Files can be renamed to the time of their modification date.
File archiving / deletion: Files modified before a certain date can be deleted or archived.
Searching: Files can be searched for by their name.
Filtering: Files can be filtered by type, date or size.
